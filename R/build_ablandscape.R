#' Build an antibody landscape
#'
#' This is a function for building and antibody landscape from a given set of antigenic coordinates and titres.
#'
#' @param object 
#' @param grid_spacing 
#'
#' @return Returns a list, with a matrix of x and y coordinates for each point
#'   to be plotted on the landscape, and a matrix of z coordinates, which are
#'   the landscape heights at each of these points.
